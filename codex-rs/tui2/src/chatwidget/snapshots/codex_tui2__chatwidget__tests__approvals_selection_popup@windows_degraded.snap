› 1. Read Only (current)           Requires approval to edit files and run
                                   commands.
  2. Agent (non-elevated sandbox)  Read and edit files, and run commands.
  3. Agent (full access)           Codex can edit files outside this workspace
                                   and run commands with network access.
                                   Exercise caution when using.

  The non-elevated sandbox protects your files and prevents network access under
  most circumstances. However, it carries greater risk if prompt injected. To
  upgrade to the elevated sandbox, run /setup-elevated-sandbox.
