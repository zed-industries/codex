**Codex just got an upgrade. Introducing gpt-5.3-codex.**

Codex is now powered by gpt-5.3-codex, our most capable agentic coding model yet. It's built for long-running, project-scale work, with mid-turn steering + frequent progress updates so you can collaborate while it runs (and it's faster too).

You can keep using gpt-5.1-codex if you prefer.
