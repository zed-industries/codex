› 1. Default      Codex can read and edit files in the current workspace, and
                  run commands. Approval is required to access the internet or
                  edit other files.
  2. Full Access  Codex can edit files outside this workspace and access the
                  internet without asking for approval. Exercise caution when
                  using.
