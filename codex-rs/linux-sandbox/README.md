# codex-linux-sandbox

This crate is responsible for producing:

- a `codex-linux-sandbox` standalone executable for Linux that is bundled with the Node.js version of the Codex CLI
- a lib crate that exposes the business logic of the executable as `run_main()` so that
  - the `codex-exec` CLI can check if its arg0 is `codex-linux-sandbox` and, if so, execute as if it were `codex-linux-sandbox`
  - this should also be true of the `codex` multitool CLI

On Linux, the bubblewrap pipeline prefers the first `bwrap` found on `PATH`
outside the current working directory whenever it is available. If `bwrap` is
present but too old to support
`--argv0`, the helper keeps using system bubblewrap and switches to a
no-`--argv0` compatibility path for the inner re-exec. If `bwrap` is missing,
the helper falls back to the vendored bubblewrap path compiled into this
binary.
Codex also surfaces a startup warning when `bwrap` is missing so users know it
is falling back to the vendored helper.

**Current Behavior**
- Legacy `SandboxPolicy` / `sandbox_mode` configs remain supported.
- Bubblewrap is the default filesystem sandbox pipeline.
- If `bwrap` is present on `PATH` outside the current working directory, the
  helper uses it.
- If `bwrap` is present but too old to support `--argv0`, the helper uses a
  no-`--argv0` compatibility path for the inner re-exec.
- If `bwrap` is missing, the helper falls back to the vendored bubblewrap
  path.
- If `bwrap` is missing, Codex also surfaces a startup warning instead of
  printing directly from the sandbox helper.
- Legacy Landlock + mount protections remain available as an explicit legacy
  fallback path.
- Set `features.use_legacy_landlock = true` (or CLI `-c use_legacy_landlock=true`)
  to force the legacy Landlock fallback.
- The legacy Landlock fallback is used only when the split filesystem policy is
  sandbox-equivalent to the legacy model after `cwd` resolution.
- Split-only filesystem policies that do not round-trip through the legacy
  `SandboxPolicy` model stay on bubblewrap so nested read-only or denied
  carveouts are preserved.
- When the default bubblewrap pipeline is active, the helper applies `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` and a
  seccomp network filter in-process.
- When the default bubblewrap pipeline is active, the filesystem is read-only by default via `--ro-bind / /`.
- When the default bubblewrap pipeline is active, writable roots are layered with `--bind <root> <root>`.
- When the default bubblewrap pipeline is active, protected subpaths under writable roots (for
  example `.git`,
  resolved `gitdir:`, and `.codex`) are re-applied as read-only via `--ro-bind`.
- When the default bubblewrap pipeline is active, overlapping split-policy
  entries are applied in path-specificity order so narrower writable children
  can reopen broader read-only or denied parents while narrower denied subpaths
  still win. For example, `/repo = write`, `/repo/a = none`, `/repo/a/b = write`
  keeps `/repo` writable, denies `/repo/a`, and reopens `/repo/a/b` as
  writable again.
- When the default bubblewrap pipeline is active, symlink-in-path and non-existent protected paths inside
  writable roots are blocked by mounting `/dev/null` on the symlink or first
  missing component.
- When the default bubblewrap pipeline is active, the helper explicitly isolates the user namespace via
  `--unshare-user` and the PID namespace via `--unshare-pid`.
- When the default bubblewrap pipeline is active and network is restricted without proxy routing, the helper also
  isolates the network namespace via `--unshare-net`.
- In managed proxy mode, the helper uses `--unshare-net` plus an internal
  TCP->UDS->TCP routing bridge so tool traffic reaches only configured proxy
  endpoints.
- In managed proxy mode, after the bridge is live, seccomp blocks new
  AF_UNIX/socketpair creation for the user command.
- When the default bubblewrap pipeline is active, it mounts a fresh `/proc` via `--proc /proc` by default, but
  you can skip this in restrictive container environments with `--no-proc`.

**Notes**
- The CLI surface still uses legacy names like `codex debug landlock`.
