//! Custom CA handling for login HTTP clients.
//!
//! Login flows are the only place this crate constructs ad hoc outbound HTTP clients, so this
//! module centralizes the trust-store behavior that those clients must share. Enterprise networks
//! often terminate TLS with an internal root CA, which means system roots alone cannot validate
//! the OAuth and device-code endpoints that the login flows call.
//!
//! The module intentionally has a narrow responsibility:
//!
//! - read CA material from `CODEX_CA_CERTIFICATE`, falling back to `SSL_CERT_FILE`
//! - normalize PEM variants that show up in real deployments, including OpenSSL-style
//!   `TRUSTED CERTIFICATE` labels and bundles that also contain CRLs
//! - return user-facing errors that explain how to fix misconfigured CA files
//!
//! It does not validate certificate chains or perform a handshake in tests. Its contract is
//! narrower: produce a `reqwest::Client` whose root store contains every parseable certificate
//! block from the configured PEM bundle, or fail early with a precise error before the caller
//! starts a login flow.
//!
//! The tests in this module therefore split on that boundary:
//!
//! - unit tests cover pure env-selection logic without constructing a real client
//! - subprocess tests in `tests/ca_env.rs` cover real client construction, because that path is
//!   not hermetic in macOS sandboxed runs and must also scrub inherited CA environment variables
//! - the spawned `login_ca_probe` binary reaches the probe-only builder through the hidden
//!   `probe_support` module so that workaround does not become part of the normal crate API

/// is deliberate: the caller only needs a safe slice boundary for the leading certificate object
/// before handing those bytes to `reqwest`, which performs the real certificate parsing.

///
/// - short form, where the length is stored directly in the second byte
