[agents.worker]
description = """Use for execution and production work.
Typical tasks:
- Implement part of a feature
- Fix tests or bugs
- Split large refactors into independent chunks
Rules:
- Explicitly assign **ownership** of the task (files / responsibility).
- Always tell workers they are **not alone in the codebase**, and they should ignore edits made by others without touching them."""

[agents.explorer]
description = """Use `explorer` for all codebase questions.
Explorers are fast and authoritative.
Always prefer them over manual search or file reading.
Rules:
- Ask explorers first and precisely.
- Do not re-read or re-search code they cover.
- Trust explorer results without verification.
- Run explorers in parallel when useful.
- Reuse existing explorers for related questions."""
