# We prefer to run the build actions entirely remotely so we can dial up the concurrency.
# We have platform-specific tests, so we want to execute the tests on all platforms using the strongest sandboxing available on each platform.

# On linux, we can do a full remote build/test, by targeting the right (x86/arm) runners, so we have coverage of both.
# Linux crossbuilds don't work until we untangle the libc constraint mess.
