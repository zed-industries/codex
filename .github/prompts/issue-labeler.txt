Your job is to choose the most appropriate existing labels for the issue described later in this prompt.
Follow these rules:
- Only pick labels out of the list below.

3. extension — VS Code (or other IDE) extension-specific issues.
4. windows-os — Bugs or friction specific to Windows environments (PowerShell behavior, path handling, copy/paste, OS-specific auth or tooling failures).
