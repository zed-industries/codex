# Security Policy

Thank you for helping us keep Codex secure!

## Reporting Security Issues

The security is essential to OpenAI's mission. We appreciate the work of security researchers acting in good faith to identify and responsibly report potential vulnerabilities, helping us maintain strong privacy and security standards for our users and technology.

Our security program is managed through Bugcrowd, and we ask that any validated vulnerabilities be reported via the [Bugcrowd program](https://bugcrowd.com/engagements/openai).

## Vulnerability Disclosure Program

Our Vulnerability Program Guidelines are defined on our [Bugcrowd program page](https://bugcrowd.com/engagements/openai).
